            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S I am deſirous to ſatiſfie all indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent men concerning the occaſion and intent of this my diſcourſe: ſo I thought good to direct the ſame eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially vnto this ſocietie, whereof I am a member; to teſtifie both how iustly or rather neceſsarily I haue beene drawn to the vndertaking and publiſhing hereof: as alſo how willing I am to ſubmit my ſelfe to your learned cenſure; the argument of my writing being ſuch as none can better iudge of then your ſelues.</p>
            <p>And firſt I protest vpon that credit which I deſire to haue among you, that I haue not vndertaken this buſineſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e of mine owne accord, as if I eſteemed of mine owne know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and obſeruation in this caſe aboue other mens. For (if it had beene thought good to haue impoſed it vppon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) I do acknowledge that there are many among vs better able then my ſelfe to haue written in this kind, vnto whome I would willingly haue put ouer my taske. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did I euer find my ſelfe prouoked hereunto vpon any
<pb facs="tcp:19994:3"/>peeuiſh humor to contradict or to diſgrace any who doe iudge otherwiſe of ſome pointes contained herein, then my ſelfe doe: many of them being ſuch as I do loue and affect well. Neither vpon any fawning humor to pleaſe or flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter any perſon whatſoeuer; which I doe eſteeme more baſe then begging. But diſclayming both hony and gall, I haue plainely ſet downe the true doctrine of Phiſicke concerning that diſeaſe which giues ſo great occaſion of diſtraction a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong many good men: eſpecially ſuch as haue not le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rning ſufficient to reſolue them of this point, or not that modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and humilitie of ſpirit to acknowledge their inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie, and to hearken vnto others whom in all reaſon they might thinke able to direct them better in ſuch a caſe.</p>
            <p>For if it be true that one man cannot be perfect in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery arte and profeſsion, and therefore in caſes out of our owne callings, we do depend vpon thoſe which haue beene trayned vp in other particular ſubiects, beleeuing men in their owne profeſsions: Why ſhould we not prefer the iudge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ments of Phiſitions in a queſtion concerning the actions and paſsions of mans bodie (the proper ſubiect of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion) before our owne conceites; as we do the opinions of Diuines, Lawyers, Artificers, &amp;c. in their proper Elements. Neither haue I done this as taking vpon me to reforme the mindes of men which are not vnder my charge (for I could willingly haue permitted euery man to enioy his owne opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion:) But being a Phiſition, and iudging in my conſcience that theſe matters haue beene miſtaken by the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; I thought good to make knowne the doctrine of this diſeaſe, ſo farre forth, as may be in a vulgar tongue conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently diſcloſed, to the end that the vnlearned and raſh conceits of diuers, might be thereby brought to better vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
<pb facs="tcp:19994:3"/>and moderation; who are apt to make euery thing a ſupernaturall work which they do not vnderſtand, proportioning the bounds of nature vnto their own capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: which might proue an occaſion of abuſing the name of God, and make vs to vſe holy prayer as vngroundedly as the Papiſts do their prophane trickes; who are readie to drawe forth their wooden dagger, if they do but ſee a maid or woman ſuffering one of theſe fits of the Mother, coniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and exorciſing them as if they were poſſeſſed with euil ſpirits. And for want of worke, will oftentimes ſuborne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that are in health, to counterfait ſtrange motions and behauiours: as I once ſaw in the <hi>Santo</hi> in <hi>Padua</hi> fiue or ſixe at one ſermon interrupting and reuiling the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, vntill he had put them to ſilence by the ſigne of the Croſſe, and certaine powerleſſe ſpelles.</p>
            <p>Wherefore it behoueth vs as to be zealous in the truth, ſo to be wiſe in diſcerning truth from counterfaiting and naturall cauſes from ſupernaturall power. I doe not deny but that God doth in theſe dayes-worke extraordinarily, for the deliuerance of his children, and for other endes beſt knowne vnto himſelfe; and that among other, there may be both poſſeſsions by the Diuell, and obſeſsions and witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft, &amp;c. and diſpoſſeſsion alſo through the Prayers and ſupplications of his ſeruants, which is the onely meanes left vnto vs for our reliefe in that caſe. But ſuch examples be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing verie rare now adayes, I would in the feare of God ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe men to be very circumſpect in pronouncing of a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſsion: both becauſe the impostures be many, and the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of naturall diſeaſes be ſtrange to ſuch as haue not loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked throughly into them.</p>
            <p>But let vs conſider a little the ſignes which ſome doe
<pb facs="tcp:19994:4"/>ſhew of a ſupernaturall power in theſe examples. For if they ſay there neede no ſuch ſignes appeare, becauſe the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill by witchcraft may inflict a naturall diſeaſe: then I ask them what they haue to doe with the Diuell, or with diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſsing of him, when he is not their preſent, but hath beene onely an externall cauſe of a diſeaſe, by kindling or corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the humours of our bodies; which diſeaſe as well as other will ſubmit it ſelfe to phyſicall indications: as is ſhewed, cap. <hi>1.</hi> Wherefore they muſt needes make him to be an internall cauſe, and to poſſeſſe the members and facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the bodie, and holde them to his vſe: or elſe they vnderſtand not what they ſay, when they doe peremptorily diſclaime naturall meanes, and auouch that they ſpeake certaine wordes, and performe certaine voluntarie motions vpon his incitation, and are hindred by him from ſpeaking other wordes which they would faine vtter. And therefore to this end diuerſe ſignes and Symptoms are alledged by them, as arguments of a ſupernaturall and extraordinarie power inhaerent in the body.</p>
            <p>One of their ſignes is <hi>Inſenſibilitie,</hi> when they doe not feele, being pricked with a pin, or burnt with fire, &amp;c. Is this ſo ſtrange a ſpectacle, when in the Palſie, the falling ſickeneſse, Apoplexis, and diuerſe other diſeaſes, it is dayly obſerued? And in theſe fits of the Mother it is ſo ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie as I neuer read any Authour writing of this diſeaſe who doth not make mention thereof. This poynt you ſhall finde proued both by authorities and examples in the <hi>4.</hi> Chapter.</p>
            <p>There alſo you ſhall find conuulſions, contractions, diſtortions, and ſuch like to be ordinarie Symptoms in this diſeaſe.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:19994:4"/>
            <p>Another ſigne of a ſupernaturall power they make to be the due &amp; orderly returning of the fits, when they keepe their iuſt day and houre, which we call periods or cicuits. This accident as it is common to diuerſe other chronicall diſeaſes, as head-aches, gowtes, Epilepſies, Tertians, Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans, &amp;c. ſo it is often obſerued in this diſeaſe of the mother as is ſufficiently proued in the <hi>2.</hi> Chapter.</p>
            <p>Another argumnt of theirs is the offence in eating, or drinking, as if the Diuell ment to choake them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. But this Symptom is alſo ordinarie in vterin affects, as I ſhew in the ſixt Chapter: and I haue at this time a patient troubled in like maner.</p>
            <p>Another reaſon of their is, the comming of the fits vpon the preſence of ſome certaine perſon. The like I doe ſhew in the ſame Chapter, and the reaſons of it, from the ſtirring of the affections of the mind.</p>
            <p>Another maine argument of theirs, is the deliuerance vpon faſting and prayer: which we will imagin to be ſo in deed, without any counterfeiting in that point. You ſhall ſee in the <hi>7.</hi> Chapter, how this may be a naturall remedie two maner of wayes: the one by pulling downe the pride of the bodie, and the height of the naturall humors therof; a verie conuenient meanes, and often preſcribed by our Authours in yong and luſtie bodies: the other by the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t perſwaſion of the patient to find releaſe by that means: which I ſhew in that Chapter by rules and authorities in our profeſsion and alſo by examples, to be a verie effectuall remedie in curing diuerſe diſeaſes of this nature.</p>
            <p>Many other ſuch like inſtances they may produce, according vnto euerie ones ſeuerall conceit: which were in vaine for me to repeate perticularly: vnleſſe I knew where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb facs="tcp:19994:5"/>they would principally inſiſt. But in the diſcourſe follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing I haue as neare as I could deſcribed al the Symptoms of this diſeaſe; whereby euerie man may readily find an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to his ſeuerall obiections.</p>
            <p>Now to teſtifie my loue and affection to this ſocietie of ours, and that I eſteeme more of the cenſure of a fewe learned and graue men, then of the opinions of a multitude of other people: I thought good to chooſe no other perſons to patronize this ſlender diſcourſe then your ſelues, who are beſt able of any in this land, or any ſuch like ſocietie elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where (that euer I could find) to iudge whether I write true doctrine or no.</p>
            <p>Wherefore deſiring you to accept it in good part, and as occaſion may ſerue to giue teſtimonie vnto it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as your iudgements and conſciences ſhall lead you, I take my leaue this <hi>2.</hi> Martii, <hi>1602.</hi>

               <p>This hee ſpeaketh of the Phiſitions of his time, whome he confuteth principally by two rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, which may ſerue for excellent rules for all men to diſcerne ſuch caſes by. The firſt is, that there is no ſupernaturall Character in theſe <hi>Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms,</hi> as hee proueth by an induction of diuerſe of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:19994:7"/>them, which in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon opinion were thought to be aboue nature: yet hee proueth to haue their naturall cauſes in the bodie of man aſwell as others haue.</p>
               <p>The ſtrength of this argument will better ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare hereafter in the particular <hi>Symptoms,</hi> which we are to entreate of: where it ſhall be made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that the moſt of them doe both depende vpon ſuch naturall cauſes as other diſeaſes haue in our bodies, and alſo are oftentimes mixed with other diſeaſes which are accompted naturall.</p>
               <p>It may likewiſe appeare by this, that whereas all other diſeaſes are knowne by their notes and ſignes which reſemble their cauſe (as <hi>Choller, Flegme, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, &amp;c.</hi> haue their proper markes, corruption and putrefaction, their proper notes and malignity his Character) ſo there muſt be ſome Character or note of a ſupernaturall power in theſe caſes (as<note n="a" place="margin">

If the diuell as an externall cauſe, may inflict a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe by ſtirring vp or kindling the humors of our bodies, and then depart without ſupplying conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall ſupernaturall power vnto it;<note n="b" place="margin">Auicen.

                  </note> then the diſeaſe is but naturall, and will ſubmit it ſelfe vnto Phyſicall cure. For externall cauſes when they are already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted, giue no indication of any remedy.</p>
               <p>The ſecond argument of this is, that theſe <hi>Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms</hi> do yeeld vnto natural cauſes, and are both pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured

But what equality of contrariety ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in degree or in power, can there be betweene a ſupernaturall ſuffocating power, and the compreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the belly or throate.

And where one is oppoſed vnto one alone, and not indifferently vnto many. Neither doe I thinke, that any man wel aduiſed, will ſay that by compreſsion of thoſe parts, he is able to ſuppreſſe the power of the diuell. The like may be ſaide of the application of cupping glaſſes, of ſweete plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, of ligatures, &amp;c. beneath, and of euell ſmelles aboue; by all which we do obſerue thoſe kindes of fits to be mitigated: and yet there can bee no ſuch contrary reſpect in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againſt a ſupernatural cauſe, as is between a remedy and a diſeaſe.

Wherefore the rule of <hi>Hyppocrates</hi> muſt needesbe true; that if theſe <hi>Symptoms</hi> do yeeld vnto naturall remedies, they muſt alſo bee naturall themſelues.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He ſecond kind of this diſeaſe is, where the animall facultie doth principally ſuffer; and it is that faculty whereby we do vnderſtand, iudge, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber things that are profitable or hurtfull vnto vs, whereby alſo we haue ſence and do feele the qualities of things, and moue to and fro, &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme diuers other voluntary actions for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie of the bodie. For nature had made vs but baſe creatures, if ſhe had giuen vs onely the vitall facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie barely to liue, and the naturall to grow, and to ſupply the expence that is daily made of naturall moiſture: If ſhe had not withall giuen vs knowledg and vnderſtanding of ſuch things as we are ſubiect vnto, and abilitie to moue our bodies at our plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, to apprehend that which is profitable &amp; to ſhun that which is offenſiue, &amp;c.

               <p>This animall facultie hath this peculiar difference from the vitall and naturall faculties, that the functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

Diuers ſuch like examples might bee procured to ſhew how the animall functions may be abuſed by our owne will. But againſt our willes this faculty doth ſuffer by conſent in the ſuffocation of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diuerſly according to the varietie of offices or functions which it performeth.</p>
               <p>The functions of it are three, the firſt is called <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall</hi> and principall ſence which doth gouerne and direct all the reſt by <hi>Imagination, Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory:</hi> which if it bee hurt either by imminution or deprauation or total aboliſhment, then the inferior functions doe neceſſarily participate with the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:19994:17"/>They are hurt by Imminution when a man doth not <hi>Conceiue, Iudge,</hi> or remember ſo well as hee ought to doe, as in dulneſſe or blockiſhneſſe,<note place="margin">Hebetudo men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis.</note> as wee call it in vndiſcretion, fooliſhnes or want of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">Imprudentia obliuio.</note> in obliuion or forgetfulnes, &amp;c.

               <p>The Internall ſence is depraued when a man doth imagine, iudge, or remember thinges that are not as if they were, or things that are, otherwiſe then they are indeed. Whether they do it in cogitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on alone, or do expreſſe it by word or deede. As

In ſome of which they will laugh, crye, prattle, threaten, chide, or ſing, &amp;c. according to the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the party or the cauſe of the affect.</p>
               <p>Theſe functions are alſo depraued in too much wakefulneſſe through the commotion of the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall ſpirits,<note place="margin">Vigilia.

               <p>The ſecond function of the animall facultie is the externall ſenſitiue function; which giueth to the eye the facultie of ſeeing, to the eare of hearing, to

               <p>This function in all theſe kindes is diminiſhed, depraued, or cleane aboliſhed, but eſpecially in this diſeaſe of the mother, we do obſcrue the offence which is done to the feeling facultie, when the parts are benummed or do not feele at all, or when they feele<note n="d" place="margin">Iuxta recep tam a medicis ſententiam do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorem hic inſero licetvideatur potius ad ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces corporis af<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fectus referen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus.</note> paine and offence, or when they feele things falſely and other wiſen then they are.</p>

               <p>The third function is that which giues mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the whole bodie. This motion ſerueth ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for a voluntary vſe onely, or for a naturall vſe alſo.

Thoſe that attended her, applied Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trige feathers vpon coales vnto her noſtrilles, and by chance through want of care there fell a great coale out of the Chafingdiſh into her boſome, where it burnt her, and made a great bliſter, but ſhe percey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued it not vntill the next day, and then complained of her breaſts. My ſelfe had a patient in this Citie yet liuing and in good health (whome I will name vnto any whome it may concerne) that endured a violent fitte of the Mother a whole day together: wherein ſhee had many ſtrong conuulſions, and ſometimes did lie as if ſhe had beene dead.

               <p>But we had of late a moſt rare example of this diſeaſe in an Eſſex Gentlewoman of good note, who being once frighted by ſquibs, fell into theſe fits of the Mother, which held her euery day, and whenſoeuer elſe ſhe did eate any comfortable meat, for the ſpace of fifteene or ſexteene yeares togither, with ſuch violent conuulſions, as fiue or ſix ſtrong men could ſcarce hold her downe. Sometimes her limbes would be contracted, ſometimes perticular Muſcles, which would cauſe ſwellings in diuerſe parts of her bodie, ſometimes ſhe would be without all maner of ſenſe. And being made beleeue by a ſtranger Phyſition that ſhe was bewitched, her fits increaſed vpon her, and grew to bee ſtronger then before.</p>

This facultie is of great neceſsitie for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunce of mankinde and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the diuerſe vſes thereof is diſtinguiſhed. For ſeeing that nature bringes vs not forth into the world perfect men, in that ripeneſſe and integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, of all humaine actions which afterwards we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto, when wee come to full growth, it was meete to be prouided of ſuch a facultie in our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies as might encreaſe ourſtature, &amp; ſtrengthen the inſtruments of the whole body, for the better per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the actions thereof.

               <p>Blood is that humor wherwith we are nouriſhed: without which the infant in the mothers wombe could neither grow &amp; increaſe in bigneſſe, nor yet liue: and therefore it was neceſſarie that thoſe that were fit for generation, ſhould be ſupplied with ſufficient ſtore of this humor, for the vſe of this part wherin the infa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is to be nouriſhed, for which cauſe there are large vaines &amp; arteries deriued vnto it for

                  <note place="margin">4. Natural. 6.</note> that the confidence of the patient in the meanes vſed is oftentimes more auailable to cure diſeaſes then all other remedies whatſoeuer.</p>
               <p>Another courſe hath beene taken ſometimes in theſe caſes, by remouing the cauſe of theſe affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or by inducing of other perturbations of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe nature. Whereby as (experience teacheth vs) moſt grieuous diſeaſes haue beene oftentimes cured beyond expectation.</p>
               <p>A yong man falling out of fauour with his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, fell thereupon into the fits of the falling ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and continued long and often moleſted there with; vntill a reconciliation was wrought with his father: who ſending him a kind letter to that effect, the yong man was preſently deliuered from that fearefull diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>A yong Maiden alſo vpon ſome paſſion of the minde, as it was credibly reported, fell into theſe fits of the Mother, and being in one of them, a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition then preſent modeſtly put his hand vnder her cloathes to feele a windie tumor which ſhee then had in her backe. But a Surgeon there alſo preſent not contented with that maner of examination, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to take vp her cloathes, and to ſee it bare:
<pb facs="tcp:19994:30"/>whereupon the Maid being greatly offended, tooke ſuch indignation at it, as it did put her preſently out of her fit.</p>
               <p>And it is no maruel that the affections of the mind doe beare ſuch rule in this diſeaſe, ſeeing we doe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue that moſt commonly beſides the indiſpoſition of the bodie: here is alſo ſome Melancholike or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricious conceit ioyned withall of loue, feare, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, iealouſie, diſcontentment, witchcraft, poyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, &amp;c. which being by policie or good inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and perſwaſions remoued, the diſeaſe is eaſily ouercome.</p>
               <p>Other matters of gouernment of them either in the fit or out of the fit, togither with the cure in regard of the internall cauſes, becauſe they are properly belonging to the Phyſition, I do purpoſely omit.</p>
